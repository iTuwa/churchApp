            Almighty and most merciful Father, we have erred and strayed from your ways like lost sheep.
            We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts. We have offended against your holy laws.
            We have left undone those things which we ought to have done; and we have done those things which we ought not to have done.
            But you, O Lord, have mercy upon us. Spare those who confess their faults. Restore those who are penitent, according to your promises declared to mankind in Christ Jesus our Lord.
            And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake, that we may live a disciplined, righteous, and godly life, to the glory of your holy Name. Amen.
